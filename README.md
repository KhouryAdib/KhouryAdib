### Hi there, I'm Adib Khoury ðŸ‘‹

I'm a UX/UI game designer with a passion for creating immersive, interactive experiences. I'm currently expanding my skillset to include Java backend development, and I'm excited to share my progress and projects with the GitHub community.

I'm currently working on:

Unnamed Space Game
Unnamed Space Game is a singleplayer third person resource management shooter game. Players must manage their time to either explore on their ship, Hunt enemies for resources, and upgrade their own or ship strength. Players have a set amount of time to gather enough resources to win. They lose if they die or run out of time. I'm doing this solo, with several paid for assets. The project is built using UnityEngine with C#.

[Unnamed Space Game is in the preproduction phase]<!--- remember to add links and screenshots later and upload the game to github pages --->

Learning Java Backend
As a UX/UI game designer, I'm always looking for ways to expand my skillset and create better, more immersive experiences for users. Recently, I've been learning Java backend development to improve my understanding of how games and applications work behind the scenes.

Here are a couple of the resources I'm using to learn Java backend:

[Bloomtech Institute of Technology](https://www.bloomtech.com/)
[CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade)
