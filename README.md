Learning Java Backend
As a UX/UI game designer, I'm always looking for ways to expand my skillset and create better, more immersive experiences for users. Recently, I've been learning Java backend development to improve my understanding of how games and applications work behind the scenes.

Here are a couple of the resources I'm using to learn Java backend:

[Bloomtech Institute of Technology](https://www.bloomtech.com/)
